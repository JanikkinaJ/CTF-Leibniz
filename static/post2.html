            <p>Node.js has revolutionized backend development with its non-blocking I/O model. In this article, we'll explore best practices for building RESTful APIs that can handle thousands of concurrent requests.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Node.js for APIs?</h3>
            <p>Node.js is particularly well-suited for building APIs because of its event-driven architecture and ability to handle many concurrent connections efficiently. This makes it ideal for real-time applications and microservices.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Principles</h3>
            <p><strong>Use Express.js or Fastify:</strong> These frameworks provide a solid foundation with routing, middleware support, and a large ecosystem of plugins.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Implement Rate Limiting:</strong> Protect your API from abuse by implementing rate limiting. Libraries like express-rate-limit make this easy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Proper Error Handling:</strong> Always handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes. Don't expose internal error details to clients.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Authentication & Authorization:</strong> Use JWT tokens or OAuth for authentication. Never store passwords in plain text.</p>
            
            <h3>Performance Tips</h3>
            <p>Use caching strategies with Redis to reduce database load. Implement pagination for large datasets. Use compression middleware to reduce response sizes.</p>
            
            <p>Monitor your API with tools like PM2 or New Relic to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.</p>
