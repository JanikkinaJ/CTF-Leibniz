            <p>Web security has become increasingly important in today's digital landscape. As developers, we need to be aware of common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Security Vulnerabilities</h3>
            <p>Let's explore some of the most common security issues that plague web applications:</p>
            
            <p><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> This occurs when user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Always escape user input before rendering it in HTML.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):</strong> Unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. Implement CSRF tokens in your forms.</p>
            
            <h3>Best Practices</h3>
            <p>Here are some fundamental security practices every developer should follow:</p>
            
            <p>1. Never trust user input - validate and sanitize everything</p>
            <p>2. Use HTTPS everywhere to encrypt data in transit</p>
            <p>3. Implement proper authentication and authorization</p>
            <p>4. Keep your dependencies up to date</p>
            <p>5. Use security headers like Content-Security-Policy</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Security should be a priority from the start of any project, not an afterthought. By following these best practices and staying informed about new vulnerabilities, you can build more secure applications.</p>
